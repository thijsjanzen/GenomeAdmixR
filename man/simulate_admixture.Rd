\usage{
simulate_admixture(
  input_population = NA,
  pop_size = NA,
  number_of_founders = 2,
  initial_frequencies = NA,
  total_runtime = 100,
  morgan = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  select_matrix = NA,
  markers = NA,
  verbose = FALSE,
  track_junctions = FALSE,
  multiplicative_selection = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_population}{Potential earlier simulated population used as
starting point for the simulation. If not provided by the user, the
simulation starts from scratch.}

\item{pop_size}{Vector containing the number of individuals in both
populations.}

\item{number_of_founders}{Number of unique ancestors}

\item{initial_frequencies}{A vector describing the initial frequency of each
ancestor. By default, equal frequencies are assumed. If a vector not summing
to 1 is provided, the vector is normalized.}

\item{total_runtime}{Number of generations}

\item{morgan}{Length of the chromosome in Morgan (e.g. the number of
crossovers during meiosis)}

\item{seed}{Seed of the pseudo-random number generator}

\item{select_matrix}{Selection matrix indicating the markers which are under
selection. If not provided by the user, the simulation proceeds neutrally. If
provided, each row in the matrix should contain five entries:
\code{location}{ location of the marker under selection (in Morgan) }
\code{fitness of wildtype (aa)} \code{fitness of heterozygote (aA)}
\code{fitness of homozygote mutant (AA)} \code{Ancestral type that
represents the mutant allele A}}

\item{markers}{A vector of locations of markers (relative locations in
[0, 1]). If a vector is provided, ancestry at these marker positions is
tracked for every generation.}

\item{verbose}{Verbose output if TRUE. Default value is FALSE}

\item{track_junctions}{Track the average number of junctions over time if
TRUE}

\item{multiplicative_selection}{Default: TRUE. If TRUE, fitness is calculated
for multiple markers by multiplying fitness values for each marker. If FALSE,
fitness is calculated by adding fitness values for each marker.}
}
\value{
A list with: \code{population} a population object, and three tibbles
with allele frequencies (only contain values of a vector was provided to the
argument \code{markers}: \code{frequencies} , \code{initial_frequencies} and
\code{final_frequencies}. Each tibble contains four columns, \code{time},
\code{location}, \code{ancestor} and \code{frequency}, which indicates the
number of generations, the location along the chromosome of the marker, the
ancestral allele at that location in that generation, and finally, the
frequency of that allele.
}
\description{
Individual based simulation of the breakdown of contiguous
ancestry blocks, with or without selection. Simulations can be started from
scratch, or from a predefined input population.
