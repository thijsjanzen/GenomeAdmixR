\title{Individual based simulation of the breakdown of contiguous ancestry blocks.}
\usage{
simulate_admixture(
  input_population = NA,
  pop_size = NA,
  number_of_founders = 2,
  initial_frequencies = NA,
  total_runtime = 100,
  morgan = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  num_threads = 1,
  select_matrix = NA,
  markers = NA,
  verbose = FALSE,
  track_junctions = FALSE,
  multiplicative_selection = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_population}{Potential earlier simulated population used as
starting point for the simulation. If not provided by the user, the
simulation starts from scratch.}

\item{pop_size}{The number of individuals in the population. If the number is
larger than the number of individuals in the input population (if provided),
additional individuals are sampled randomly from the input population to
reach the intended size.}

\item{number_of_founders}{Number of unique ancestors}

\item{initial_frequencies}{A vector describing the initial frequency of each
ancestor. By default, equal frequencies are assumed. If a vector not summing
to 1 is provided, the vector is normalized.}

\item{total_runtime}{Number of generations}

\item{morgan}{Length of the chromosome in Morgan (e.g. the number of
crossovers during meiosis)}

\item{seed}{Seed of the pseudo-random number generator}

\item{num_threads}{number of threads. Default is 1. Set to -1 to use all
available threads}

\item{select_matrix}{Selection matrix indicating the markers which are under
selection. If not provided by the user, the simulation proceeds neutrally. If
provided, each row in the matrix should contain five entries:
\code{location}{ location of the marker under selection (in Morgan) }
\code{fitness of wildtype (aa)} \code{fitness of heterozygote (aA)}
\code{fitness of homozygote mutant (AA)} \code{Ancestral type that
represents the mutant allele A}}

\item{markers}{A vector of locations of markers (relative locations in
[0, 1]). If a vector is provided, ancestry at these marker positions is
tracked for every generation.}

\item{verbose}{Verbose output if TRUE. Default value is FALSE}

\item{track_junctions}{Track the average number of junctions over time if
TRUE}

\item{multiplicative_selection}{Default: TRUE. If TRUE, fitness is calculated
for multiple markers by multiplying fitness values for each marker. If FALSE,
fitness is calculated by adding fitness values for each marker.}
}
\value{
A list with: \code{population} a population object, and three tibbles
with allele frequencies (only contain values of a vector was provided to the
argument \code{markers}: \code{frequencies} , \code{initial_frequencies} and
\code{final_frequencies}. Each tibble contains four columns, \code{time},
\code{location}, \code{ancestor} and \code{frequency}, which indicates the
number of generations, the location along the chromosome of the marker, the
ancestral allele at that location in that generation, and finally, the
frequency of that allele.
}
\description{
Individual based simulation of the breakdown of contiguous
ancestry blocks, with or without selection. Simulations can be started from
scratch, or from a predefined input population.
