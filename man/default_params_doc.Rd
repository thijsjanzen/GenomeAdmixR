\arguments{
\item{module}{Chosen module to simulate, either created with
\code{module_ancestry} or
\code{module_sequence}.}

\item{total_runtime}{Number of generations}

\item{migration}{settings associated with migration, should be created with
\code{\link{migration_settings}}}

\item{multiplicative_selection}{Default: TRUE. If TRUE, fitness is calculated
for multiple markers by multiplying fitness values for each marker. If FALSE,
fitness is calculated by adding fitness values for each marker.}

\item{verbose}{Verbose output if TRUE. Default value is FALSE}

\item{num_threads}{number of threads. Default is 1. Set to -1 to use all
available threads}

\item{morgan}{Length of the chromosome in Morgan (e.g. the number of
crossovers during meiosis)}

\item{markers}{A vector of locations of markers (relative locations in
[0, 1]). If a vector is provided, ancestry at these marker positions is
tracked for every generation.}

\item{track_junctions}{Track the average number of junctions over time if
TRUE}

\item{pop_size}{The number of individuals in the population. If the number is
larger than the number of individuals in the input population (if provided),
additional individuals are sampled randomly from the input population to
reach the intended size.}

\item{select_matrix}{Selection matrix indicating the markers which are under
selection. If not provided by the user, the simulation proceeds neutrally. If
provided, each row in the matrix should contain five entries:
\itemize{
\item{location of the marker under selection (in Morgan) }
\item{fitness of wildtype (aa)}
\item{fitness of heterozygote (aA)}
\item{fitness of homozygote mutant (AA)}
\item{Ancestral type that represents the mutant allele A}
