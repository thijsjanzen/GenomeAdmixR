\title{Calculate allele frequencies at a specific marker location}
\usage{
calculate_marker_frequency(pop, location)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{Population for which to estimate allele frequencies at the
given marker}

\item{location}{A vector or scalar of location(s) along the chromosome for
which allele frequencies are to be calculated. Locations are in Morgan.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the frequency of each present ancestor at the
provided location. Ancestors with frequency = 0 are dropped out of the table.
The tibble contains three columns: location, ancestor and frequency.
}
\description{
Calculate the relative frequency of each ancestor in the
population at a specific marker location
}
