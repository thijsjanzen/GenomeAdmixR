\arguments{
\item{source_pop}{Source population from which isofemales are generated}

\item{n}{Number of isofemales to be generated}

\item{inbreeding_pop_size}{Population size of the population used to generate
homozygous individuals}

\item{run_time}{Maximum runtime used for inbreeding}

\item{morgan}{Size of the chromosome in Morgan (e.g. the number of crossovers
during meiosis)}

\item{seed}{Random number generator seed}

\item{progress_bar}{Displays a progress_bar if TRUE. Default value is FALSE}
}
\value{
A list of length \code{n}, where each entry is a fully homozygous
isofemale.

\description{
Creates isofemale individuals, given a population
}
\details{
To create an isofemale, two individuals are randomly picked from
the source population. Using these two individuals, a new population is
seeded, of size \code{inbreeding_pop_size}. Then, this population is allowed
to inbreed until either \code{run_time} is reached, or until all individuals
are homozygous and genetically identical, whatever happens first.
