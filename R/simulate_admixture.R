#' Individual based simulation of the breakdown of contiguous ancestry blocks.
#' @description Individual based simulation of the breakdown of contiguous
#' ancestry blocks, with or without selection. Simulations can be started from
#' scratch, or from a predefined input population.
#' @param input_population Potential earlier simulated population used as
#' starting point for the simulation. If not provided by the user, the
#' simulation starts from scratch.
#' @param pop_size Vector containing the number of individuals in both
#' populations.
#' @param number_of_founders Number of unique ancestors
#' @param initial_frequencies A vector describing the initial frequency of each
#' ancestor. By default, equal frequencies are assumed. If a vector not summing
#' to 1 is provided, the vector is normalized.
#' @param total_runtime  Number of generations
#' @param morgan Length of the chromosome in Morgan (e.g. the number of
#' crossovers during meiosis)
#' @param seed Seed of the pseudo-random number generator
#' @param select_matrix Selection matrix indicating the markers which are under
#' selection. If not provided by the user, the simulation proceeds neutrally. If
#' provided, each row in the matrix should contain five entries:
#' \code{location}{ location of the marker under selection (in Morgan) }
#' \code{fitness of wildtype (aa)} \code{fitness of heterozygote (aA)}
#' \code{fitness of homozygote mutant (AA)} \code{Ancestral type that
#' represents the mutant allele A}
#' @param progress_bar Displays a progress_bar if TRUE. Default value is TRUE
#' @param markers A vector of locations of markers (relative locations in
#' [0, 1]). If a vector is provided, ancestry at these marker positions is
#' tracked for every generation.
#' @param track_junctions Track the average number of junctions over time if
#' TRUE
#' @param multiplicative_selection Default: TRUE. If TRUE, fitness is calculated
#' for multiple markers by multiplying fitness values for each marker. If FALSE,
#' fitness is calculated by adding fitness values for each marker.
#' @param num_threads number of threads, default is 1. Setting the number of threads to -1 will use all available threads. Multi-threading is currently not supported on windows.
#' @return A list with: \code{population} a population object, and three tibbles
#' with allele frequencies (only contain values of a vector was provided to the
#' argument \code{markers}: \code{frequencies} , \code{initial_frequencies} and
#' \code{final_frequencies}. Each tibble contains four columns, \code{time},
#' \code{location}, \code{ancestor} and \code{frequency}, which indicates the
#' number of generations, the location along the chromosome of the marker, the
#' ancestral allele at that location in that generation, and finally, the
#' frequency of that allele.
