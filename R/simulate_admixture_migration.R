#' Individual based simulation of the breakdown of contiguous ancestry blocks in
#' two populations linked by migration
#' @description Individual based simulation of the breakdown of contiguous
#' ancestry blocks, with or without selection. Simulations can be started from
#' scratch, or from a predefined input population. Two populations are
#' simulated, connected by migration
#' @param input_population_1 Potential earlier simulated population used as
#' starting point for the simulation. If not provided by the user, the
#' simulation starts from scratch.
#' @param input_population_2 Potential earlier simulated population used as
#' starting point for the simulation. If not provided by the user,
#' the simulation starts from scratch.
#' @param pop_size Vector containing the number of individuals in both
#' populations.
#' @param initial_frequencies A list describing the initial frequency of each
#' ancestor in each population. Each entry in the list contains a vector with
#' the frequencies for all ancestor. The length of the vector indicates the
#' number of unique ancestors. If a vector not summing to 1 is provided, the
#' vector is normalized.
#' @param total_runtime  Number of generations
#' @param morgan Length of the chromosome in Morgan (e.g. the number of
#' crossovers during meiosis)
#' @param seed Seed of the pseudo-random number generator
#' @param select_matrix Selection matrix indicating the markers which are under
#' selection. If not provided by the user, the simulation proceeds neutrally.
#' If provided, each row in the matrix should contain five entries:
#' \code{location}{ location of the marker under selection (in Morgan) }
#' \code{fitness of wildtype (aa)} \code{fitness of heterozygote (aA)}
#' \code{fitness of homozygote mutant (AA)} \code{Ancestral type that
#' representes the mutant allele A}
#' @param progress_bar Displays a progress_bar if TRUE. Default value is TRUE
#' @param markers A vector of locations of markers (relative locations in
#' [0, 1]). If a vector is provided, ancestry at these marker positions is
#' tracked for every generation.
#' @param track_junctions Track the average number of junctions over time if
#' TRUE
#' @param multiplicative_selection Default: TRUE. If TRUE, fitness is
#' calculated for multiple markers by multiplying fitness values for each
#' marker. If FALSE, fitness is calculated by adding fitness values for each
#' marker.
#' @param migration_rate  Rate of migration between the two populations.
#' Migration is implemented such that with probability m (migration rate) one
#' of the two parents of a new offspring is from the other population, with
#' probability 1-m both parents are of the focal population.
#' @param stop_at_critical_fst option to stop at a critical FST value
#' , default is FALSE
#' @param critical_fst the critical fst value to stop, if
#' \code{stop_simulation_at_critical_fst} is TRUE
#' @param generations_between_update The number of generations after which the
#' simulation has to check again whether the critical Fst value is exceeded
#' @param sampled_individuals Number of individuals to be sampled at random from
#' the population to estimate Fst
#' @param number_of_markers Number of markers to be used to estimate Fst
#' @param random_markers Are the markers to estimate Fst randomly distributed,
#' or regularly distributed? Default is TRUE.
#' @param num_threads number of threads, default is 1. Setting the number of threads to -1 will use all available threads. Multi-threading is currently not supported on windows.
#' @return A list with: \code{population_1}, \code{population_2} two population
#' objects, and three tibbles with allele frequencies (only contain values of a
#' vector was provided to the argument \code{markers}: \code{frequencies},
#' \code{initial_frequencies} and \code{final_frequencies}. Each tibble contains
#' five columns, \code{time}, \code{location}, \code{ancestor}, \code{frequency}
#' and \code{population}, which indicates the number of generations, the
#' location along the chromosome of the marker, the ancestral allele at that
#' location in that generation, the frequency of that allele and the population
#' in which it was recorded (1 or 2). If a critical fst value was used to
#' terminate the simulation, and object \code{FST} with the final FST estimate
#' is returned as well.
