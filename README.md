# What is GenomeAdmixR?
A package to perfrom individual-based simulations of genome evolution with ancestry.

# Demonstration GenomeAdmixR
Thijs Janzen gave a presentation demonstrating GenomeAdmixR (then named isoSIM) at the R User Group at the University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. You can watch his presentation [here](https://streaming3.service.rug.nl/p2gplayer/Player.aspx?id=cxbKvM)  (audio starts after 1 min)
